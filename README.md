# Reaction Time Test ðŸ˜±

A simple web reaction time test application built by MASTER T.

## Overview

The web test gauges reaction time by having a user click the instant the screen changes from red to yellow. It provides immediate performance feedback and several opportunities at testing.

## Lang Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## How It Works

1. **Start Screen**: The program begins with a red screen with instructions in English.
2. **Waiting Phase**: The screen is red after the user has clicked to begin and instructs the user to wait for the yellow screen.
3. **Test Phase**: After a random waiting time, the screen becomes yellow and instructs the user to click as soon as possible.
4. **Results**: Upon clicking, the screen goes black and shows the user's reaction time in milliseconds.
5. **Restart**: An additional click will restart the test.

## Features

- **Random Timing**: Each test uses a different random delay before showing the yellow screen (between 1-5 seconds).
- **False Start Detection**: If a user clicks before the yellow screen appears, they receive a warning message.
- **Immediate Color Changes**: No transition effects are used, ensuring accurate timing measurements.
- **Millisecond Precision**: Reaction times are measured with millisecond accuracy.
